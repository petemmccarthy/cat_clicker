# Cat Clicker Project

This is the project I built whilst doing the [Udacity Javascript Design Patterns](https://eu.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) course. It is built with JavaScript, html and very basic css.

The course was mainly about the MVC type pattern and separation of application concerns.
